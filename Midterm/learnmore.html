   <center><p>Growing up in New York City subtly fueled me wanting to be a photographer. I've always seen my city a real life movie waiting to be filmed by everyone's eyes. Being raised by parent's who had grown up in different cultures merging a blended Latin family, I have memories that have been snapshot and saved into my memory for years. My maternal grandmother had been living in Red Hook all my life when I started taking the train to school. I can always see the train coming up the tracks heading toward Coney Island as I'd wait for a downtown F train.</p>

   <p> New York has always been a canvas for my work. After taking the downtown F train from Red Hook, we'd always go home to our apartment near the navy yard in Farragut Public Housing. When I'd look out my window I could imagine these beautiful pictures of Manhattan's skyline in the skies.</p>
       
       <p><h2> New York is a Canvas</h2></p>
       <p>Recently, I've been using New York City as a place for some videography. I regularly work with a designer and was able to work on a mini movie in collaboration. I seen New York as a city where life can become repetitive and boring yet we're all so alive. The main character found this brand on a instagram while riding through a New York City. See the mini movie below: </p>
